3D kinematics of mudskipper crutching on inclined and deformable substrates

### About
This repo contains data files and computer code to compare the 3D kinematics of African mudskippers (_Periophthalmus barbarus_) crutching on nine environmental conditions: three substrates (dry sand, semi-solid mud, and solid) at three inclines (0°, 10°, 20°)

### Content
- data file (.csv) containing the timing of major kinematic events for 267 strides and pectoral fin spread measurements for 124 strides extracted from videos
- R code to compare the contact data (timing and spread)
- raw xy coordinates of landmarks in dorsal and lateral views from 101 strides (videos digitized in DLTdv8)
- 3D xyz coordinates of landmarks from 101 strides (generated in MATLAB)
- R code to compare the angular data (pectoral fin and body angles)
- metadata file with column/variable definitions and exact frame numbers for the start and end of each focal stride and key kinematic events

### Source
Videos were collected at Clemson University between 2010 - 2014 in partial fulfillment of a Ph.D. for Sandy Kawano while under the supervision of Rick Blob. A subset of this dataset was previously analyzed: McInroe et al. (2016). Tail use improves performance on soft substrates in models of early vertebrate land locomotors. _Science_, 353(6295), 154-158. DOI: 10.1126/science.aaf0984

Raw videos for this project can be accessed on OpenScienceFramework: https://osf.io/ayqbw/
